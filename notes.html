           <h2 class="note-heading">Holiday Favorites</h2>
           <p>Happy holidays! I’ve been spending time with family and friends in my hometown, and I always love coming home. There’s nothing quite like my 
            parents’ cooking and a comfy couch. I’m lucky to have a family full of great cooks, so I’ve been on dessert duty for all family dinners. No 
            complaints from me though, I’ve always preferred baking to cooking. This year I tried two new cookie recipes: snickerdoodles, requested by my 
            grandma, and hot cocoa cookies, just because they looked yummy. Thankfully, both were a success. If I had to recommend one, it would be the 
            snickerdoodles. They are a classic and were a hit with everyone. 
            </p>
            <p>I’ve also been knitting for friends, which is something I’ve never really done before. Knitting usually takes me so long that, selfishly, I 
            don’t want to give projects up once they’re finished. This year, though, I made three gifts and actually enjoyed the whole process! Picking 
            patterns I thought each friend would love and appreciate and finally giving the finished project was very rewarding. My attitude toward gift 
            knitting has definitely changed. Keeping those projects small is the key! Plus, getting to see my friends in the things I made them is just too cool. 
            </p>
            <p>Another holiday favorite of mine has been The Great British Bake Off. I can’t believe it took me so long to start watching it because I love a 
            good baking show. I started with the newest season and I am a big fan of Jasmine, who ended up winning. Her flavor choices always sounded delicious, 
            her designs and decorations were the cutest, and her outfits were just as good.
            </p>
            <p>Now that my gift knits are finished, I’m back to working on my cloud sweater. I’m hoping to finish it in time to wear it before the weather warms up again. 
            I think I can do it! 
            </p>

           <h2 class="note-heading">Glove Archive</h2>
           <p>December 24th: I ordered some new short circular needles for this project, and I loved them. I would so much rather use those than do magic loop. 
                Magic loop for just the little thumb is already too much. Also, I have been making a lot of edits to this pattern. All of my changes
                have been inspired by the Petite Knit Penny Gloves. Instead of any ribbing, I did one round of purling at both ends of the mittens. 
                I also knit the wrist part of the gloves a little longer than the suggested four inches. All I have left right now is the thumb on 
                one glove, then I'm done! 
            </p>
            <p>December 27th: I got to give these gloves to my friend Katw this morning! While working on these, I was not a huge fan of this yarn. 
                I love the color, and I don't mind the feel of it, but it was not very forgiving to any loose stitches around the thumb pick up. But 
                maybe thats a me problem! The first thing Kate said was that she loved the yarn, so that made me feel better! These knit up very quickly,
                so I would totally recommend this pattern to any beginners or for any gift knit. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="note-heading">Headband Archive</h2>
            <p>December 10th: I casted this project on using a provisional cast on as suggested in the pattern.
                I've only ever used long tail cast on, so it definitely took me a few attempts. But, I got it!
                This headband is going to be a Christmas present for my friend Lainey, so I am hoping to get it
                done in the next few days. I love this yarn so much. I just recently finished another project using 
                this yarn as well. It is so soft, I love the color, and I think my friends will really like it too!</p>
            <p>December 11th: I was able to work on this a bit today! Right now it is 15cm. I am liking this pattern.
                Love a good repetitve pattern where I don't really need to pay attention or think about what I am doing. 
            </p>
            <p>December 17th: It is off the needles and blocking currently! I used the kitchener stitch to sew the two ends
                together. It looks really nice and seamless! I had never used this technique before, so I had to watch a few 
                videos, but it was easy to pick up!
            </p>

            <h2 class="note-heading">Sophie Scarf Finishing Touches</h2>
            <p>Today, I am blocking the Sophie Scarf I knit for a friend for Christmas. I'm hoping that while blocking the scarf will grow a bit in length. 
                I am also planning to sew in a custom tag I ordered from an Etsy shop this summer. I've never done that in a project before, so I am excited to see how it looks!
            </p>
            <p>Just blocked. It looks likes its going to end up at 92 cm! I wish I wrote down the length before blocking, I want to guess it was around 
                85cm?? Not too sure. 
            </p>
