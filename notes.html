            <p>Today, I am blocking the Sophie Scarf I knit for a friend for Christmas. I'm hoping that while blocking the scarf will grow a bit in length. 
                I am also planning to sew in a custom tag I ordered from an Etsy shop this summer. I've never done that in a project before, so I am excited to see how it looks!
            </p>
            <p>Just blocked. It looks likes its going to end up at 92 cm! I wish I wrote down the length before blocking, I want to guess it was around 
                85cm?? Not too sure. 
            </p>

           <h2 class="note-heading">Headband Archive</h2>
           <p>December 10th: I casted this project on using a provisional cast on as suggested in the pattern.
                I've only ever used long tail cast on, so it definitely took me a few attempts. But, I got it!
                This headband is going to be a Christmas present for my friend Lainey, so I am hoping to get it
                done in the next few days. I love this yarn so much. I just recently finished another project using 
                this yarn as well. It is so soft, I love the color, and I think my friends will really like it too!</p>
            <p>December 11th: I was able to work on this a bit today! Right now it is 15cm. I am liking this pattern.
                Love a good repetitve pattern where I don't really need to pay attention or think about what I am doing. 
            </p>
            <p>December 17th: It is off the needles and blocking currently! I used the kitchener stitch to sew the two ends
                together. It looks really nice and seamless! I had never used this technique before, so I had to watch a few 
                videos, but it was easy to pick up!
            </p>
